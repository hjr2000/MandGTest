M&G Coding Test - Submitted by H. Jackson-Robbins 7/10/18
---------------------------------------------------------

Thanks for the opportunity to take this test. 


Discrepancies
-------------

There are some discrepancies between the expected validation result and what is stated in the readme.md document:

1. 'Invalid user defined SEDOL' scenario - I changed the expected message from 'Checksum digit does not agree with the rest of the input' to the actual message seen 'Checksum digit does not agree with the first 6 characters.' 

In the real world I would have confirmed with the business that this deviation from the spec was ok but it seems reasonable to assume the correctness of the new message in this case.

2. In other scenarios, the expected message "Input string was not 7-characters long" is actually presented as "Input string was not 7-characters long." (note the full stop). I have amended the expected result accordingly.

3. Regarding the SEDOL null/empty string input in scenario 'Null, empty string or string other than 7 characters long' - as the empty string and null are effectively the same thing in terms of input, I have removed the empty string input from the examples in that scenario.
 

Enhancements
-------------

Change utilities to static?

Check that the text in the table is ok, e.g. 'Null' not 'null' is catered for

Go below the UI

Parallelisation using Specflow+

Look into Cypress.io

Deprecated stuff


And finally

Note that on my machine at least, there is an occasional issue where you run test and it immediately goes to failed state but no text is shown giving a reason. A recompile fixes this issue.
